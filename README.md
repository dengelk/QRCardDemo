# QRCardDemo
Demo web page to play around with QR codes. Makes a business style card with a QR code on it and allows one to place custom html information on the card.

This demo shows how to implement some of the most excellent QR code posted by davidshimjs/qrcodejs (on GitHub). It requires a single file qrcode.js (or qrcode.min.js). Once you have the demo index.html file and the qrcode.js in a folder set up as a website server you can play around with the demo.

Once you have the index.html file from this project and the qrcode.js hosted on a website (I use GoLive with MS Code on my local PC) you can play around with the card demo web app. You can check QR Code, Title, Url, or Body and then set the selected color accordingly. You can use the Init buttons to init some demo cards. Finally Add Print Card(s) that you wish to print and when you are ready hit the Print button.
